# Space Exploration Technologies (short: SpaceX)

SpaceX sells rockets.

Its gross income is unknown, but they have multiple launches every month. Their website lists $61.2 million dollars per Falcon 9, which is the rocket used for the majority of their launches.

They have over 40 future contracts currently and more than 10m completed missions.

Their greatest expense is the rocket engine (not the fuel). This is because they need to build a rocket for every launch (although they recently landed their first rocket for reuse, so this may no longer be a major expense).\

They have a net profit by an unknown amount. (private company)

They had alot of success because NASA is moving away from relying on the Russians for ISS resupply missions and SpaceX will do it alot cheaper than the Russians. Another reason is that the Russia failed many of their launches too.
